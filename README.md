These enchanted running shoes bestow upon their wearer the remarkable 'Fleetness of Foot,' a mystical power that allows them to move with a grace and swiftness unmatched.
With each step, time seems to blur, and the world rushes by in a breathtaking blur of colors and sounds.

The wearer becomes a living gust of wind, dancing effortlessly through forests, over mountains, and across plains.

It is said that those who possess the 'Fleetness of Foot' can traverse great distances in the blink of an eye, leaving all others in awe of their speed and agility.

Legends tell of heroes who, equipped with these shoes, have outrun storms, escaped perilous situations, and even raced against the very wind itself.

To wear these shoes is to embrace the essence of boundless motion and untamed swiftness.

This mod adds a single pair of Boots 'Running Shoes'

Equipping these shoes grants the wearer 20% run speed bonus.

However, the boots are made of thin leather and feathers so not very durable, wear them at your own risk!

Trimmable (1.20>), the boots also serve a fashion purpose.
